"""sdlc_pretooluse_hook.py — turn the AI-Native SDLC gate from ADVISORY into ENFORCED.

Registered as a KiroCrew **PreToolUse** script hook. KiroCrew feeds the hook event
as JSON on STDIN (Kiro-CLI-compatible) with at least:

    {"hook_event_name": "PreToolUse", "cwd": "...",
     "tool_name": "...", "tool_input": {...}}

Exit code contract (KiroCrew ScriptHook):
    0 = allow
    2 = BLOCK the tool; stderr is shown to the model
    other = warning only (does NOT block)

So every refusal path here must exit exactly 2, and every "not my business" path
must exit 0. A crash would exit 1 = warning = silently allow, therefore the whole
body is wrapped and any internal error is converted to an explicit allow with a
warning on stderr. Failing OPEN is deliberate: a buggy gate must not brick the
user's ability to edit files. The CI gate is the fail-closed backstop.

--- How it decides ---------------------------------------------------------------
The repo names its CURRENT change in a pointer file:

    .sdlc/active        -> one line: the intent slug (e.g. "quality-pass")

Artifacts live in   intent/<slug>/{intent,spec,plan}.md   (the skill's layout).

A write to a SOURCE file is allowed only when `plan.md` for the active slug is
accepted -- i.e. the Build gate is open. Writes to the artifacts themselves, and
to anything listed in `.sdlc/allow`, are always permitted, otherwise you could
never start a change.

If a repo has no `.sdlc/` directory the hook is inert (exit 0): this must not
break every other project on the machine.
